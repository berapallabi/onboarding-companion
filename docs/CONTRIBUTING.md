# Contributing Guide

Welcome to the **Smart Onboarding Companion**! We're excited to have you contribute. This guide will help you get set up and familiar with our coding standards.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm
- A local or hosted PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase, Neon, or local Postgres)

### 2. Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
POSTGRES_URL="your-postgresql-url"
AUTH_SECRET="your-auth-secret"
GITHUB_ID="your-github-id"
GITHUB_SECRET="your-github-secret"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

### 4. Database Setup
We use Drizzle ORM. To push the schema to your database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

To seed the database with initial milestones, documents, and roles:
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

## Development Workflow

- **Local Server**: Run `npm run dev` to start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Database Prototyping**: If you modify `db/schema.ts`, use `npx drizzle-kit push` to apply changes immediately.
- **Seeding**: If you update `lib/constants.ts` or `db/seed.ts`, re-run `npm run db:seed` to refresh the curriculum.

## Coding Standards

### 1. Server Components First
Use React Server Components (RSC) by default. Only add `'use client'` when you need interactivity (state, effects, event listeners).

### 2. Modern Design Aesthetic
- Follow the **Neo-Arcade** design system: vibrant secondary colors, glassmorphism, and bold typography.
- Use the utility classes in `app/globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`.

### 3. Type Safety
- Always define interfaces for component props.
- Use the types generated by Drizzle for database entities.

## Pull Request Process
1.  Create a branch from `main`.
2.  Ensure your code passes linting: `npm run lint`.
3.  Test your changes by running through the assessment flow.
4.  Submit your PR with a clear description of what changed and a screenshot (if applicable).
